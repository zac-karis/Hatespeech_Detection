# Hatespeech_Detection
# Hatespeech and offensive language detection from socialmedia data.
# Uses different machine learning algorithms:
          # Naive Bayes
          # Random Forest
          # Linear Regression
          # Scale vector machine
# Using predefined test cases, Naive Bayes algorithm is more accurate compared to the other algorithms.
